                <h3>What is Continuous Testing?</h3>
                <p>Continuous Testing is a software testing type in which the product is evaluated early,
                    often,
                    and throughout the entire Continuous Delivery (CD) process. Continuous testing uses automated
                    tests to ensure teams receive immediate feedback to quickly mitigate as many risks as possible
                    throughout the software development lifecycle. Moreover,
                    team members are able to continuously learn about their product and what can be done to increase
                    quality and reliability.<br><br>The goal of Continuous Testing is to test early and test often.
                    The process involves stakeholders like Developer,
                    DevOps,
                    QA and Operational system. </p>
                <h4>Benefits of Continuous Testing</h4>
                <p>Let's break down a few benefits of continuous testing!
                    <ul>
                        <li>Increase release rate: Speed up delivery to production and release faster</li>
                        <li>Communication transparency: Eliminate silos between the development,
                            testing,
                            and operation teams</li>
                        <li>Accelerate testing: Run parallel performance tests to increase testing execution speed
                        </li>
                        <li>Find errors: Ensure as many errors are found before being released to production</li>
                        <li>Reduce business risks: Assess potential problems before they become an actual problem
                        </li>
                        <li>Test early and often: Tested throughout the development,
                            delivery,
                            testing,
                            and deployment cycles</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h4>The Key Elements of a Successful Continuous Testing Process</h4>
                <p>To put into place a continuous testing process within your company,
                    you’ll need at the very least the following four elements.</p>
                <h5>1. A Continuous Integration Tool</h5>
                <p>A basic continuous integration tool allows the team to integrate new code that has been deposited
                    into a central repository to produce a new build of a software solution. Before depositing new
                    code into the central repository,
                    team members can work independently to develop a new feature or new functionalities without
                    affecting the version used by other team members. </p>
                <h5>2. Environment Provisioning</h5>
                <p>Having to create a test environment every time a team member wants to test a feature adds
                    unnecessary steps (update the application, update the database if necessary, restart the
                    services, etc) that slow the development team down and end up wasting a ton of time over the
                    course of an entire project. A platform like Docker can make this process much smoother and much
                    simpler. Creating images requires an initial investment,
                    but in the long run,
                    you’ll likely save time. The container-based provisioning step can also be managed through a
                    continuous integration tool as well. </p>
                <h5>3. End-To-End Testing</h5>
                <p>Environment provisioning and a continuous integration tool allow team members to verify new
                    changes faster and more efficiently. After that,
                    end-to-end testing,
                    which integrates test scenarios,
                    test scripts and test automation tools into a single platform,
                    ensures software quality by testing the application from beginning to end and generating
                    detailed test results. Using these results,
                    it’s very easy for developers to identify the source of an error or what caused software quality
                    to regress,
                    allowing developers to fix these issues quickly. Moreover,
                    test automation doesn’t leave room for human errors,
                    which means test results are always reliable. Thanks to the power of end-to-end testing,
                    teams can control the quality of the software solutions they produce much more easily. </p>
                <h5>4. Teamwork</h5>
                <p>The last key ingredient of a successful continuous testing process is very simple: teamwork ! A
                    continuous testing process seeks to integrate testers and quality assurance specialists directly
                    into the development team,
                    allowing them to work side-by-side with developers to elaborate test strategies together. In the
                    end,
                    the code that the team develops is much more solid,
                    as the entire team is involved in the quality assurance process. </p>
                <h4>How to Perform Continuous Testing?</h4>
                <p>Continuous testing should be implemented at every stage of your CI/CD pipeline. It works best by
                    using the most recent build in an isolated environment. You can also set up test suites at every
                    point code changes,
                    merge or releases. This will help reduce time and effort on testing but still reap quality
                    rewards. </p>
                <p>Below are some of the best practices to help you implement continuous testing to best serve your
                    organization’s needs. </p>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Adopt more test automation:</b>automation increases the speed and errors coverage at
                            which testing can function. Automating as much as you can in the development lifecycle
                            will help you achieve faster releases. </li>
                        <li><b>Tracking metrics:</b>Use quantifiable metrics to keep track of your success or
                            failure rate during testing </li>
                        <li><b>Keep communication transparent:</b>Keep your communication lines transparent to
                            prevent the testing pipeline from becoming siloed. Active communication is the key to
                            achieving the balance necessary to effectively carry out continuous testing. </li>
                        <li><b>Integrate performance testing into delivery cycle:</b>Performance testing is an
                            integral part of continuous testing as it helps check the speed,
                            responsiveness,
                            and stability of your application </li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>Challenges of Continuous Testing</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The traditional process is limiting cultural shift among Development & QA professionals.
                        </li>
                        <li>Lack of DevOps skills and the right tools for testing in Agile & DevOps environments.
                        </li>
                        <li>Heterogenous test environments which will never reflect the production environment.
                        </li>
                        <li>Conventional testing process and loosely defined test data management. </li>
                        <li>Longer code integration cycles create integration issues and late defect fixes </li>
                        <li>Insufficient and ineffective resources and test environments </li>
                        <li>Complex application architecture and business logic that restricts DevOps adoption.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Continuous Testing Tools</h4>
                    <p>Tools are very useful to help make continuous testing even faster. Below are some of the best
                        tools for your specific requirements. </p>
